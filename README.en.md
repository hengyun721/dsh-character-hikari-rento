**Rento Hikari from *This Is the Terminal Stagnation Committee*, shipped in two parallel forms:
a DeepSeek Harness plugin and a portable skill.**

The self-proclaimed "flawless strongest beautiful girl", the trailing `～` `♪` `啦` `哦` `呢`,
and the girl underneath the armor: afraid of hot food, ghosts and her own feelings.

Both editions are **generated from one `character.json`** and released independently — separate
versions, separate tags, separate releases. Neither is an artifact of the other.

> ⚠️ **Spoilers**: `references/`, `人设.md`, `证据与归属说明.md` and the copied `references/`
> inside both packages describe plot details from all six volumes. **README and `docs/` are spoiler-free.**

## Two editions

| | [`hikari-rento`](packages/plugin) | [`hikari-rento-skill`](packages/skill) |
|---|---|---|
| What | DeepSeek Harness **bundle plugin** | Portable **skill** package |
| How it loads | Declares an agent preset; **replaces** the session persona | The host loads it on demand; **lends** a voice |
| Tools | Line-by-line copy of the official `standard` preset | Whatever the host provides |
| Install | `npm i hikari-rento` / plugin manager | Copy the folder / unpack the `.tgz` |
| Tag | `plugin-v*` | `skill-v*` |

## Install

### Plugin (DSH)

```bash
npm i hikari-rento
```

Then in DSH: **Settings → Plugins → install** `hikari-rento@latest`, restart the client, and
**open a new session**. From a checkout, point the installer at `packages/plugin/`.

### Skill (any agent)

Copy [`packages/skill/`](packages/skill) into your agent's skills directory, or unpack the
`hikari-rento-skill-<version>.tgz` from the release:

```bash
tar -xzf hikari-rento-skill-1.0.0.tgz -C ~/.claude/skills/
```

Then start a fresh session and say "恋兔光模式".

### Always open a new session

Switching the preset inside an existing session hits
`dsh-scope: scope key is already bound to a parent` — a preset-registry edge case, unrelated to this plugin.

## What the plugin does

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Replaces the session persona** | Registers `deployment:persona-prefix`, shadowing the preset's deployment persona |
| **Keeps the full toolset** | Files, shell, search, subagents, workflows, skills — same list as the official `standard` preset |
| **Stays in character only at the end** | Engineering language while working; her voice, one to three sentences, for the answer |
| **Knows what she does not know** | Every fact carries a 〔我〕experienced / 〔听〕heard / 〔不知〕unknown / 〔忘〕erased tag |
| **Refuses borrowed credit** | Experiences from elsewhere and battles others fought — she corrects you instead of playing along |
| **Short by default** | One or two sentences, no stage directions, no bracketed narration |

## Configuration

No configuration is required — the bundled patch already makes **"角色：恋兔光"** the default preset
for new sessions. To opt out, delete the trailing `- id: agent-preset-registry` block and reinstall.

```yaml
- id: character-hikari-rento
  name: 'hikari-rento'
  config:
    detail: full              # minimal | standard | full
    fewShotEnabled: true
    sectionName: deployment:persona-prefix
    sectionOrder: 0
    includeRuntimeContext: true
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `detail` | `standard` | Prompt verbosity; this bundle ships `full` |
| `fewShotEnabled` | `true` | Append 15 short few-shot lines |
| `sectionName` | `deployment:persona-prefix` | Section name. The default **shadows** the deployment persona; change it only when mounting globally |
| `sectionOrder` | `0` | `0` puts her first; `10150` appends her at the end instead |
| `includeRuntimeContext` | `true` | Turning this off also removes sandbox and approval guidance — all or nothing |

### Detail levels

| Section | Content | `minimal` | `standard` | `full` |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `core` | Who she is, how she talks, prohibitions | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `conversation` | Conversation discipline | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `speech` | Speech-pattern cheat sheet | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `personality` | Personality, weak points, the one trigger | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `dimension` | Which continuity she is in, and where her knowledge stops | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `relationships` | Relationship table across allies, schools, organisations | | ✓ | ✓ |
| `values` | Values | | | ✓ |
| `roleplay` | How to act while doing agent work | | | ✓ |
| `retrieval` | Which reference file answers which question | | | ✓ |

## Reference routing

`full` appends a routing paragraph; only four kinds of questions go look something up.

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| Quote attribution, and which events are not hers | `references/guardrails.md` |
| World common sense: organisations, geography, power system | `references/world-commons.md` |
| Teammates' and acquaintances' abilities | `references/team-abilities.md` |
| Anything else | `references/persona.md` |

The absolute path is resolved at load time from `import.meta.url`, so the plugin works wherever it is installed.

Edit `character.json`, then `npm run build`; both packages regenerate and `npm run check` compares every artifact.

## Docs

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) | Both editions, upgrades, uninstall, troubleshooting |
| [docs/skill.md](docs/skill.md) | How the skill edition differs, packaging, install |
| [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) | Every config field, detail levels, the `sectionName` collision |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | How the bundle works, the generation chain |
| [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) | What the checks cover and how to add one |
| [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md) | npm publish, the two tag lines, release checklist |

## Development

```bash
npm run build      # character.json → every artifact in both packages
npm run check      # artifacts are in sync with character.json
npm test           # dependency-free structural checks (80)
npm run pack       # package both editions into dist/
npm run verify     # check + test
```

CI runs `npm run verify` on Node 20 and 22, then uploads one artifact per edition.

## Releasing

Two independent tag lines:

```bash
npm version patch -w packages/plugin
git tag plugin-v$(node -p "require('./packages/plugin/package.json').version")

npm version patch -w packages/skill
git tag skill-v$(node -p "require('./packages/skill/package.json').version")
```

See [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md) for the full checklist.

## Known limitations

- **She still drifts.** Reference routing is a prompt-level discipline, not a host mechanism.
- **The persona is compressed.** Six volumes into a dozen prompt sections.
- **Verified at the package level.** Artifact consistency and patch structure are asserted; activation in DSH depends on the plugin manager version.
- **Fan work.** See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## License and credits

- **Code**: MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Character material**: belongs to the original author and publisher. This repository is an
  **unofficial fan project**, ships no novel text, and is non-commercial.
- **Translation**: the Chinese edition was a fan translation — **translator: 明日风 et al.** See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).
